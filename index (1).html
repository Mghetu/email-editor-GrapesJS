  index.html

  This is the entry point for the GrapesJS‑based MJML email builder.  The page
  loads the core GrapesJS library and the MJML and Tailwind plugins directly
  from public CDNs.  These scripts are version‑pinned to stable releases
  verified to exist on the chosen CDNs.  See README.md for details.

  The editor itself is bootstrapped in assets/js/main.js where plugins are
  configured, the canvas is styled, and custom blocks and export commands are
  registered.  Tailwind CSS is only injected into the editor’s iframe via
  canvas.styles in main.js to avoid polluting the outer page.

    <!--
      GrapesJS core library – latest stable version (0.22.12).
      Loaded from jsDelivr CDN.  This library exposes the global `grapesjs`
      object used to initialise the editor.

    <!--
      GrapesJS MJML plugin (v1.0.7).
      This plugin registers a preset that adds MJML components and provides
      support for real‑time MJML compilation inside GrapesJS.  The file
      exported by this package is named `index.js` rather than the more
      common `*.min.js`, so be sure to reference `dist/index.js` here.

    <!--
      GrapesJS Tailwind plugin (v1.0.11).
      This plugin integrates Tailwind CSS blocks and utilities within GrapesJS.
      It’s loaded from jsDelivr with the standard minified filename.

    <!--
      MJML browser compiler (v4.15.3).
      The MJML compiler doesn’t ship a `dist` directory – instead the
      compiled bundle lives in `lib/index.js`.  After loading this script
      you get a global `mjml` function that can be used to compile
      MJML strings to HTML.

    <!--
      FileSaver helper (v2.0.5).
      Included to enable saving MJML and HTML exports directly from the
      browser.  If you don’t need download functionality you can remove this.

      Base page styles.  We use Tailwind locally only for this wrapper page.

      separately into the editor’s iframe (see main.js).
